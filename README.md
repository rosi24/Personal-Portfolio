# Challenges Faced

- **Creating my Repository** - The main challenge I faced was creating my repository on GitHub and linking it to my code. With the support of my mentor, I was able to begin to understand what I had done incorrectly and what I needed to do to recify it.

- **Aligning text** - Another challenge I faced was aligning the text on the 'About' page to ensure that the text was aligned to the right and the photo was aligned to the left. Once I created div classes with the section tab, I was able to align the text using CSS.

- **Contact Page** - Once I had added a home button to each page, I found that my Contact page realigned. My mentor supported me to disciver that I had a missing div tag.

- **Scroll button to the navbar** - I found it difficult to adjust and add to the code to enable the 'Home' button to take the user back to the navbar. Once the a href was changed from <a href="#home"> to <a href="#navbar">, with the support of my mentor, this rectified the problem and the user was able to return to the navbar using the 'Home' button with ease.

- **Responsive Dimensions** - I found this increedibly challenaging and did not succed in mastering this.

- **'Send button Contact page** - Once I entered the information and submitted the form, I kept getting a '405 Not Allowed' error message, but this was only happening in the live environment and not the testing environment. I posted this in the Slack community and was given the advice to change the `method` value to `get` instead of `post`. This resolved the error.
