This portofolio is designed for potential employers or collaborators to find out more information about who I am, the skills set I possess and the projects I have worked on.

I wanted my target audience to begin to understand ....... and showcase my existing work.

# Challenges Faced

The main challenge I faced was creating my repository on GitHub and linking it to my code. With the support of my mentor I was able to understand what I needed to do to>>>>.

Another challenge I faced was aligning the text on the 'About' page to ensure that the text was aligned to the right and the photo was aligned to the left. Once I created div classes with the section tab, I was able to align the text using CSS.
